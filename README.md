The Denitrifying Sulfur (S) conversion-associated Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (DS-EBPR) process was recently developed for treating urban and industrial saline wastewater. The process is characterized by its unique microbial ecology that integrates carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and S biotransformation.

However, operational instability arises due to its numerous parameters and intricate bacterial interactions. This study introduces a two-stage interpretable machine learning approach utilizing XGBoost, gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), random forest (RF), and CatBoost, to predict S conversion-driven P removal efficiency and optimize the anaerobic–anoxic alternating DS-EBPR process. The first stage utilized the XGBoost regression model, achieving an R2 value of 0.948 for predicting sulfate reduction (SR) intensity from anaerobic parameters after feature engineering. The second stage involved the CatBoost classification and regression model integrating anoxic parameters with the predicted SR values for predicting P removal efficiency, reaching an accuracy of 94% and an R2 value of 0.93, respectively. This study identified the important environmental factors influencing reactor performance, including SR intensity (20–45 mg S/L), influent P concentration (<11.3 mg P/L), mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) ratio (0.55–0.72), influent C/S ratio (0.5–1.0), anoxic reaction time(5-6 hours), and MLSS concentration (>6.50 g/L). A user-friendly graphic interface was developed for easier DS-EBPR process optimization and control, with stage one variance ~13.60% and stage two ~9.28%. This approach streamlines determination of optimal conditions for enhanced P removal in the DS-EBPR process.
